# Cat-Light-JS

 # Bulb and Cat Image Toggler

This JavaScript code creates a simple web application that allows users to toggle between a lit bulb and a cat image. The application consists of two images, a button to turn the bulb off, and a button to turn the bulb on.

## Overview

### HTML

The HTML code defines the structure of the web application. It includes two `<img>` elements to display the bulb and cat images, and two `<button>` elements to control the images.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript code defines the functionality of the web application. It uses the `getElementById` method to select the bulb and cat image elements, and the `addEventListener` method to add event listeners to the buttons.
